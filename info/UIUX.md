- Navigation between pages is simple and easy for users.
- Buttons are clear and distinguishable. They also have hover and focus effects so users can tell if the buttons are selected or not.
- Design is consistent throughout the website. Colours are not random and are part of the design choice. We used a similar design for showcasing the quizzes and the questions so users would have some familiarity.
- Website scales responsively down to mobile sizes through the use of flex and grid.
- Website is not cluttered with unecessary designs/colours/text. 
- Forms don't have too much detail and are clean for users to use.
- Language used is concise and easy for users to understand.
